  <h1>Chicken Teriyaki</h1>
   <p> <strong>Teriyaki chicken </strong> is a Japanese dish of grilled chicken brushed with a mixture of soy sauce, mirin, and sake. The word teriyaki is a compound that describes both the marinade and cooking technique: “teri” means gloss and “yaki” means to cook, fry, or grill. </p>

      <h2>Chicken Teriyaki Ingredients</h2>
     </ul>

   <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup low-sodium teriyaki marinade</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons prepared horseradish</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chili oil</li>
    <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>1 bunch broccoli, cut into florets</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into strips</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1 pineapple - peeled, cored, and cut into 6 wedges</li>
    <li>2 cups cooked white rice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon black and white sesame seeds (optional)</li>
    <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced (optional)</li>
   </ul>

   <ul><h2>Directions</h2></ul>

   <ol>
    <li>Pour teriyaki marinade, horseradish, and chili oil into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, at least 4 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Coat chicken in teriyaki marinade and cook on the prepared grill until no longer pink and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Meanwhile place broccoli florets and red pepper strips in a large bowl. Drizzle with sesame oil and toss to coat. Add garlic powder, black pepper, salt, and crushed red pepper and toss to coat again.</li>
    <li>Place broccoli and red pepper strips in a grill basket and grill, turning occasionally, until tender-crisp, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Grill pineapple until soft and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
    <li>Slice pineapple and chicken into 1-inch cubes. In 4 separate bowls layer rice, chicken, pineapple, broccoli, and red peppers. Garnish each bowl with sliced green onions and sesame seeds. Drizzle extra teriyaki sauce over each bowl if desired.</li>
   </ol>
